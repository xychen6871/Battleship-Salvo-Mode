# Battleship-Salvo-Mode

## Introduction

In this game of Battleship, the number of shots a player can fire is directly dependent on the number of ships the player has. For example, if a player has 5 ships remaining, then he/she can fire 5 shots. The number of shots a player can fire is decremented by 1 every time one of his/her ships is sunk. The game ends when one player has no ships remaining.
